# Tutorial Builder

This project generates the tutorial index and pages,\
in the `./web` folder of the Tutorial subsite.

This project is also run when building the Tutorial site,
so it should be built first.

See the [Tutorial](../Tutorial/Tutorial.md) documentation
for more info in the source files.

## Running

Open `TutorialBuilder.code-workspace` with VSCode.\
Then press `[F5]` to launch it.\
