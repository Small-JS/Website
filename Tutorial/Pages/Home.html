	This tutorial will teach you how to program in SmallJS.<br>
	First we'll go though some basics of the elegant Smalltalk language.<br>
	You can try out these expressions in the Playground page on this same site.<br>
	It's most convenient if you open a second browser window for this, side-by-side.<br>
