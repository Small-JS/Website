<div class="tutorialText">
	The SmallJS standard library is located in the SmallJS repo folder:
	<a href="https://github.com/Small-JS/SmallJS/tree/main/Smalltalk/Smalltalk.md" target="_blank"><code>./Smalltalk</code></a> .<br>
	Every class is implemented in a separate file with extension: <code>*.st</code> .<br>
	Further subfolders are used to group classes logically,<br>
	but their location does not affect their use.<br>
	All classes are unique global variables.<br>
	<br>
	You can browse the documentation of <i>all</i> classes in the
	<a href="https://small-JS.org/Reference/Reference" target="_blank">class Reference</a>.<br>
	<br>
	Method names in SmallJS are kept mostly the same as their JS equivalents.<br>
	So you can also browse the Mozilla
	<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web" target="_blank">MDN documentation</a>
	for implementation details.<br>
	<br>
	The remainder of this tutorial section focuses on using basic library functionality,<br>
	Things that are often hardcoded in other languages, like strings, numbers and collections.<br>
	So only limited subset of all classes.<br>
	<br>
	Examples here can be evaluated in the Playground on this site.<br>
	(We'll make a full application in the next section)<br>
