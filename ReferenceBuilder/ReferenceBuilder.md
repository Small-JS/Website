# Reference Builder

This project generates the HTML class reference index and pages,\
in the `./web` folder of the Reference subsite.

The source for is the file: ../Reference/Pages/DocumentedClasses.json ,
that is generated by calling the SmallJS compiler with the -d option first.

This project is also run when building the Reference site,
so this should be built first.

See the [Reference](../Reference/Reference.md) documentation
for more info in the source files.

## Running

Open `ReferenceBuilder.code-workspace` with VSCode.\
Then press `[F5]` to launch it.\
